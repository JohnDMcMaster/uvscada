AmScope / ScopeTek / Anchor Chips USB camera driver
Copyright 2011 John McMaster <JohnDMcMaster@gmail.com>

Going to prototype in libusb and maybe eventually write a V4L2 driver.
Mostly based on USB protocol dumps, so enjoy the magic numbers
I have an AmScope MD1800.  Anything else detected *might* work
If you want to get it supported, send me USB capture of the following operations in their own files:
-Plug in camera to Windows
-Plug in camera to Windows, launch scope software
-Plug in camera to Windows, launch scope software, do a SHORT live video capture (at least half a second, try not to do more)
-Plug in camera to Windows, capture TWAIN picture
	Send me the picture since I'll need it to validate the data
		Be creative! ;)
	Note program used.  AmScope software is noisy since it always likes to capture a live feed
	Sourceforge program allows only camera image
